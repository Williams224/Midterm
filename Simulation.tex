\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:Simulation}
It is crucial to any particle physics experiment to understand and be able to calculate the behavoiur of the detector and apparatus being used.  No detector is perfect, therefore only a fraction of the particles created in the process being studied actually get fully measured and reconstructued.  From this subset of detected particles one has to infer the total number of particles created and any relevant distributions related to the measurement in question, the only practical way to calculate these detector efficiencies is with a full detector simulation.  A full detector simulation is also crucial for detector performance studies, understanding backgrounds and comparisons between theory and experiment.

The complexity of particle physics detectors and the many degrees of freedom in the underlying problem behind a detector simualtion make it unfathomably complex and highly multi-dimensional.  Consequntly, the ``monte carlo''(MC) or statistical sampling method is used to perform these simulations due to the fact it deals with multi dimensinal problems very well and it makes the problem conceptually far easier to understand.  More specifically direct monte carlo is used.

The first step in the monte carlo simulation is the generation of a pp interaction.  This is the responsibility of the event generator, which generates particles with randomly generated properties sampled from the correct distributions.  In \lhcb \pythia is the defualt generator used for general purpose production, but \herwig++ is sometimes used as a cross check\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs,Herwig}.  Both of these generators also simulate the hadronisation of the particles created in the hard pp interaction but \herwig uses a cluster model and \pythia uses a string model.  There are also some specialised generators used which include: \bcvegpy for the production of \Bc mesons, GenXicc for \Xic production and Hiijing for heavy ion collisons \cite{bcvegpy,Gyulassy:1994ew,Chang:2007pp}.

The next stage of the simulation process is the transportation of the generated particles through the detector and all the interactions with the detector material that occur.  In \lhcb this is performed by the \geant toolkit which is a well established software framework solely created to simulate the interatctions of particles with matter \cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}.  It is this stage of the simulation process, as performed by \geant, that is the subject of study in this report.  \geant has the capability to simulate all relevant hadronic, electromagnetic and optical interactions in a wide energy range for many long lived particles. Futhermore, \geant manages the geometry of the apparatus being simulated and also has the capbaility to simulate magnetic fields that are present at all collider based particle physics experiments.

\geant was first commisioned in 1993 as a result of studies that looked at how modern computing techniques could impove the existing fortran based GEANT frameworks that date back to 1974\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh,Brun:118715}.  These studies lead to \geant being implemented as an object orientated framework in C++.  One of the many advantages of object orientation is the ease by which improvements and refinements to the existing code can be made.  Consequently, there are regular new releases of \geant, the latest version being 10.1\cite{g410.1rn}, although this is yet to be implemented in \lhcb.  When a new release of \geant is adopted into the \lhcb simulation package it is important to validate the reuslts of the new package and understand any discrepancies compared to the previous version.  Part of the study presented in this report is a comparison of electromagnetic physics results between \geant version 9.5.p02 and version 9.6.p04 for two seperate scenarios, both of which are important to \lhcb.

The object orientated design of \geant means that it is very easy to have a variety of models avaiable for each interaction process; it is well known that the model giving the optimum agreement with data varies for different energy ranges and different particle types.  Consequently, it is important to be able to tailor the simulation to the specific scenario under investigation.  However, with the large number of interaction processes simulated and the large array of long lived particles to consider even a small selection of models for each process and particle would quickly lead to a very extensive range of possible configurations for the same scenario.  Therefore, \geant provides a set of physics lists (PL) each of which specifies a fixed set of models designed to be optimal for a smaller range of scenarios.  For example, there are PLs available for low energy scenarios which would specify models that show the best agreement with data at lower energy.  The effect of PL choice for scenarios relevant to \lhcb also forms part of the study detailed in this report.
